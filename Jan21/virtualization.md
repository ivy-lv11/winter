## memory virtualization machanism : address translation  
1. when any memory referene is generated by the process, it is translated by the processor in the following manner: PA = VA+base  
each memory reference generated by the process is a virtual address; the hardware in turn adds the contents of the base  
register to this addresss and the result is a PA that can be issued to the memory system.  
2. the bounds register is there to help with protection.
